    "The preliminary sizing of UAVs aims at defining the main drone characteristics and selecting the components based on a few **sizing scenarios**. The sizing scenarios are part of the specification process and may include both transient and endurance criteria, such as maximum rate of climb and hover flight endurance. The final overall design has to consider simultaneously the various sizing scenarios that may impact the components selection through **design drivers**."
