Image compression
Communication chain
Cryptography

Two key parameters

Scheme to achieve best compression ratio
Max bit rate that can be transmitted through 500 Hz

at the end of the session we should

go through the entire file properly.

relation between entropy and compression

How is an image stored in a file?
What is the math behind behind data compression?
What is lossless compression?


How to create a probability distribution of a signal?
How to add noise to it?
How are bandwidth, entropy and bit rate related?
Finally relation between bit rate and noise?

reducing number of pixels - compression
