Handley Page wind tunnel - turbulent intensity - 0.5%
initial experiment of Handley page wind tunnel is flawed because a turbulence intensity of 0.5% results in N=4.28 which is a terrible wind tunnel because
in order to study transition, you first need a laminar flow with low Tu. N=4.28 is already a very high intensity

Turbulence intensity =  standard deviation of fluctuating wind velocity/mean wind speed.

Adjust the Re range while doing the batch analysis. If in the calculations, the Re goes below or above the range of values given, the solution will not converge

Outputs
Check the Re and N
Endurance vs location of transition
natural transition vs alpha
Cl vs alpha (optional)
effect of transition on pressure distribution, lift, drag, ENDURANCE and boundary layer intergral quantities
skin friction vs location (at different transition locations) For -ve Cf, you can find the separation bubbles. Based on the bubble location, you can install trips

dCp/dx = 0 (condition for forming a local separation bubble)

how to proceed with the aero project
read about the facebook wing and simulate it. Read the paper
simulate the mark1 wing and compare results with facebook wing while simultaneously addressing point 1 on why Handley wind tunnel sucks
pick another wing from UIUC or suggest design changes and discuss why the suggested design would be better

you can find out whether the surface of the solar panels themselves have the same aerodynamic integrity as the laminar wing surfaces
how would conditions be different while climbing to the necessary altitude and descent
