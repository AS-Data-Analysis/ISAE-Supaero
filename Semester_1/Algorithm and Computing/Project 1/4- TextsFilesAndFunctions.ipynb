For instance, the pronoun *her* occurs 4 times, but we also find `her.` occurring 1 time and the capitalized `Her`, also 1 time. Of course we would like to add those counts to that of *her*. As it appears, the tokenization of our text using `split` is fast and simple, but it leaves us with noisy and incorrect frequency distributions. \n",
