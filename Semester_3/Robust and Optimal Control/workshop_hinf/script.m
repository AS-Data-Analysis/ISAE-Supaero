% First requirement: the transfer between the reference input and the error must
% be small at low frequency to have a low steady-state error (see Figure 1). The
% controller K(s) must be computed so that ||W1*S||_inf < 1, where W1(s) =
% 1/Sdesired(s) = (s+1)/s. A weighting functions cannot have a pole on the
% imaginary axis, so a regularization is performed: W1(s) = (s+1)/(s+0.001).
%
% Second requirement: robustness w.r.t. an additive uncertainty must be ensured
% (see Figure 2). The controller K(s) must be computed so that ||Wa*K*S||_inf < 1,
% where Wa(s) = 1/KSdesired(s) = (s+3)/300. A transfer function cannot have less
% poles than zeros, so a regularization is performed: Wa(s) = (s+3)/(s+300).

%
% It could be guessed that the controller order must be at least equal to 3:
%  * ||S||_inf < s/(s+1) means that S(jw)~jw (derivator) at low frequency => K(s) must have
%    an integrator, i.e. K(s)=Kt(s)/s. This ensures that S(s) = 1/(1+K(s)*G(s)) =
%    s/(s+Kt(s)*G(s)) is equivalent to s/(Kt(0)*G(0)) when s tends to 0 (low frequency).
%  * The system is very unstable, since G(s) is open-loop unstable and there is an
%    integrator in K(s). A first way to improve stability is to add a proportional
%    integral controller (1+tau1*s)/s to K(s) instead of just an integrator. A second way
%    is to add a derivative feedback which has a stabilizing effect. But ydot is not
%    measured, so a pseudo-derivator s/(1+tau*s) of y should be added to K(s). Both
%    contributions are required here to stabilize the system and have a satisfactory
%    phase margin. So at this stage, K(s) is a linear combination of (1+tau1*s)/s and 
%    s/(1+tau*s), i.e. the structure of K(s) is (a_2*s^2+a1*s+a0)/(s*(1+tau*s)).
%  * S(jw)~1 at high frequency, so ||KS||_inf < 300/(s+3) means that deg(den(K(s)) = 
%    deg(numK)+1 = 3 (roll-off). A third pole must thus be added to K(s), which is
%    finally a transfer function with degree 2 in the numerator and 3 in the denominator.
