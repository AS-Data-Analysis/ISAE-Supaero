-------------------
System requirements
-------------------

The GSS library of the SMAC toolbox can be used on all platforms (Linux, Mac and Windows). All
routines run on Matlab 2017b or higher. They should run on older releases, but no validation has
been performed.

The Symbolic Math toolbox is required to use the routine sym2gss. The LFR toolbox and the Robust
Control toolbox are required to use the routines lfr2gss/gss2lfr and uss2gss/gss2uss respectively.

The APRICOT Library of the SMAC Toolbox is required to use the routine data2gss. A limited version
can be freely downloaded at http://w3.onera.fr/smac/apricot.
