%%% HERE please choose the desired phase in degrees (e.g 40)
phase = 40;
phi = phase*pi/180
% defining the a parameter
a = (sin(phi)+1)/(1-sin(phi))

% NOTE 1 : we have a constraint for the motor current Imax = 0.66 A, so we cannot ask more ...
% you need to take into account this constraint and the maximun input current,
% NOTE 2 : please consider a reference step of 10 degrees to that
% HERE : you shall compute the k gain with respect to the current constraint and
% the transitory gain of the controller that is a
k = 1 %0.66/a/10*(180/pi) %TO_BE_COMPLETED % 10 is multiplied because it is a 10 deg step

% next step, you need to compute find the cutoff frequency of the open-loop
% system including the k gain and the gain of the controller (root a)
margins = allmargin(openloop_ss*k*sqrt(a)) %TO_BE_COMPLETED

% gets the cutoff frequency considering from the robustness structure
Wc = margins.GMFrequency %TO_BE_COMPLETED

% then, you shall compute the tau parameter
tau = 0.2672 %1/(Wc*sqrt(a)) %TO_BE_COMPLETED

% Finally, constructs the compensator as
lead = tf(k*[a*tau 1],[tau 1]);

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% To draw the conclusions, you should be able to answer the following questions
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Is the system stable and robust to torque loss ?
% The system is stable but robustness depends on the phase value.

% What happens when we fix a bigger margin phase ?
% Increasing the phase increases a. Since there is a current constraint,
% the gain decreases which worsens the performance by increasing the steady
% state error and reducing the time response.

% The k gain is a free parameter ?
% No, it depends on a and the current constraint.

% Considering the current constraint, which is the value of a and k, when a margin phase of 50Â° is imposed
% a = 7.5486         k = 0.5010

% Could one make use of an integrator in such a controller design to
% suppress the torque loss disturbance?
% No
